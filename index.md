### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

Lab 4, part 1 was one of my many favorites because I liked being able to code equations that were automatically solved. Then after testing and seeing that the equations were accurate I felt proud and that was one of the best moments in my labs. 

* Lab 6

Lab 6, part 2 is one of my favorites because I know and play BlackJack all the time, so getting to code and technically play BlackJack through coding was really fun. Also, coding to where it could tell that you would bust was cool and I didn't know computers could do that. 

* Lab 10

Lab 10 was my favorite because it was the most challenging. This was the first lab I got really stumped on and being able to get out that hole and get it down felt really good. During this lab I wrote a lot of code that we haven't wrote in other labs that's why it felt harder then others.
