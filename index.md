### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

Lab 4, part 1 was one of my many favorites because I liked being able to code equations that were automatically solved. 

* Lab 6

Lab 6, part 2 is one of my favorites because I know and play BlackJack all the time, so getting to code and technically play BlackJack through coding was really fun. 

* Lab 10

Lab 10 was my favorite because it was the most challenging. This was the first lab I got really stumped on and being able to get out that hole and get it down felt really good.
